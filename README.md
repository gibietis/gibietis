Hello there, fellow human (allegedly).

My name is Igor and this is my GitHub repository. I'll use it in a dual purpose, serving both as a *curriculum and a platform for my studies*.

You can find my recent work in the **[first-steps](https://github.com/gibietis/first-steps) repository**.

I am currently taking a degree in **System Analysis and Development** while studying *computer science fundamentals, Git and GitHub, Docker and Python* on my own. I'm new to IT field, earning a *Bachelor's degree in law from Mackenzie Presbyterian University* in 2022.
